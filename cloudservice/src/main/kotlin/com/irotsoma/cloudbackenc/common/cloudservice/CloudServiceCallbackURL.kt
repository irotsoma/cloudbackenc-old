 * Callback url object for cloud service authorization flows.

 * This object allows the central controller caller (e.g. CloudBackEnc UI) to allow the central controller to provide a
 * url for the user to complete the authorization process for any service that requires user input to explicitly
 * authorize CloudBackEnc to access their account.  The central controller calling application must implement a rest
 * controller that accepts a POST with this object as the body.
